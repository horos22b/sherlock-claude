  "description": "The butler committed the crime using the candlestick. The motive was theft from the safe. On the night of the murder, the butler, who had been planning this crime for weeks, waited until the businessman was alone in his study. He entered the room under the pretense of serving a late-night drink. When the businessman's back was turned, the butler struck him on the head with the candlestick, killing him instantly. The butler then opened the safe, which he had previously learned the combination to, and emptied its contents. To cover his tracks, he created a false alibi by manipulating the workplace attendance record and disposed of his bloodstained gloves and cleaning supplies at a nearby shop. The butler's actions were motivated by financial desperation and a grudge against his employer for years of perceived mistreatment."
