I'm serious, she leaks like a sieve. Any time she hears the smallest tidbit of information, she makes sure to let me know - and even when she means to keep news secret, she can't help herself! Boy has this news of her dog disappearance traveled fast - I bet that people in the next town have already heard it by now!\"\n\n\"Ok, anything else?\"\n\n\"nothing.. but please find that damn dog. Yvonne is so worried, and if you find him, I can get some rest after she stops telling me about it.\""
