  "description": "We all gather in Mrs Hudson's living room. On the coffee table, there is a vase with a bunch of violets. In a corneer of the room, a dog is eating from a bowl, paying no attention to us. Holmes starts without preamble.\n\nAn easy case to solve. A letter, with no ransom demand, typed most probably on a Remington, so valued in the publishing industry. A very considerate culprit, or anxious not to draqw attention. A discreet abduction during the usual walk of our client: this most probably points to a close acquaintance. \n\nThe nephew, reporter at the times? Given the article on the neighboring Grosvenor Investments company, with very specific details about bribes, the scenario becomes crystal clear: last Thursday, on March 8, the nephew sees and recognises the parliamentarian Oppenheimer when going to visit his aunt, understands he has a scoop, and devises a strategem so as to enter discreetly in the premises, but the barking of the dog near the door may jeopardize hs action. \n\nHe cannot simply tell Mrs Nance that he plans on kidnapping the dog because Yvonne is well-known not to be able to keep a secret and is afraid of losing his story. He therefore takes the ball in secret, uses it and/or food to lure the dog, and then leads his dog off of the premises. The rest is transparent.\n\nWe can now go and explain to Mrs Nance.."
