-------

<g>What this project does.<g>


<y>This program is a proof of concept testing the capabilities of chatbots via fictitious mysteries.

It does this in a very specific way that we will go into later.</y>


-------

<g>Why do this? Why mysteries?</g>


<y>Mysteries have several advantages in the use to test chatbots. They test, amongst other things, the chatbot's:</y>

<p>     - critical thinking and analytical skills

     - ability to create a mental map of a situation

     - attention to detail and the ability to pick out clues

     - long term and needle-in-the-haystack recall

     - creativity to think of theories

     - perspective-taking skills 

     - emotional intelligence, the ability to determine human motive and human nature and infer conclusions from it

     - the ability to weigh different often conflicting theories and use empirical evidence to determine which ones are true.

     - overall multi-modal thinking.

     - planning and implementing high-level projects</p>

-------

<g>But not all mysteries are the same!</g>


<y>It is important to consider the type of mystery we use here. Basically they are three types:</y>

<p>    - static mysteries  (short stories, books and movies). 

    - real life mysteries  

    - mystery games</p>

<y>We'll take each in turn.</y>


-------

<g>Deficiencies in Static Mysteries</g>


<y>On the surface you'd think that just feeding in detective novels would be an easy way to do this but there are downsides:</y>

<p>    - They are meant to be enjoyed, not solved. They often hide or otherwise give false information and don't give the reader enough information.

    - They do not allow for planning. The reader is at the mercy of where the writer wants to go next.

    - Most don't focus on process. Instead they are more interested in painting a picture with a mystery as a backdrop.</p>


-------

<g>Deficiencies in real-life mysteries</g>


<y>Again on the surface, choosing real-life, current cases would seem ideal but they are out of scope for current chatbots, since they don't have the bandwidth to handle a real case. 

Interrogations, footwork, stake-outs, examination of large amounts of bookwork and other evidence, tripping up suspects would require a bot far more capable than available now.


If static mysteries don't allow for any planning, real-life mysteries are too broad.</y>


-------

<g>Enter the Mystery Game.</g>


<y>Mystery games offer the middle choice. There are several classes of mystery game which allow hobbyists to play detective including:</y>

<p>    - interactive video games (Chronicles of Crime, LA Noire)

    - competitive board games (Detective, Arkham)

    - Evidence hunting games (Unsolved case files, murder mystery party, Her Story)

    - straight narrative games (sherlock holmes consulting detective, gumshoe, mortum medieval detective)</p>


<y>For the purposes of testing a chatbot they offer several advantages:</y>

<p>    - they have a limited number of choices. The player can choose x number of next moves and follow through. 

    - they have an answer or answers! you can readily tell if you are on the right or wrong track.

    - they are quite challenging. It often takes a lot of the skills listed above to solve them</p>


-------

<g>Project Focus</g>


<y>In this project, we've chosen Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. It is a straight narrative game with a fixed format in cases.

We chose it specifically because of its difficulty. It is known to be one of the most difficult of this genre of games out there, with a reputation 
for making people 'feel stupid'. It also has a large community, which discusses cases online in user groups.

The goal of this project is to simulate claude solving these cases and seeing how well it does.</y>

-------

<g>The program:</g>

<y>Enter Sherlock Claude. Sherlock Claude is simple framework that allows you to:</y>

<p>    - feed mystery premises into the chatbot

    - have a chatbot proceed to investigate these mysteries using its own skills

    - have the chatbot give a potential answer

    - determine how well the chatbot does.</p>

<y>It uses two agent instances that talk to each other:</y>

<p>    - a Referee, which knows the content of the case, and the evidence behind it.

    - an Investigator, which talks to the referee to gain clues and determine answers.</p>


<y>In short the referee knows the truth of the case and doles it out, the investigator puts together the pieces.</y>

<g>Next Steps</g>


<y>The next steps here are divided into immediate and long term.


Immediate steps here are:</y>

<p>    - uploading the fan created cases tested here to github after talking to the case owners

    - reaching out to Space Cowboys to test the rest of the published cases

    - bot investigation optimizations (memory, summarization, note taking)

    - benchmarking different claude instnaces</p>


<y>Long-term steps potentially include:</y>

<p>     - implementing different approaches to the investigation process (specialized agents)

    - branching out to other mystery games and game types

    - creating new, standardized benchmark based off a set of private cases

    - bulk generation of case training data to be used to improve models (eg. gamifying real life cases).</p>

------

<g>Takeaway</g>

<y>We have presented 'Sherlock Claude' here, which in our minds provides a valuable benchmark for 
measuring attributes of intelligence in chatbots that are under-represented in other tests.


Attributes like long term planning, emotional intelligence, mind-maps and weighing conflicting evidence,
creativity, amongst others can be evaluated subjectively.


However in the fixed mode of a game with a concrete score, this can be turned into a measurable metric.
Since the difficulty and scope of attributes needed to solve these cases is so large, it is likely to be a 
very open-ended metric.</y>

<y>This project heavily relied on testing with casees from the game Sherlock's Holmes Consulting Detective. We used fan-made cases, but there are a 
series of these games sold by Space Cowboys, main site here:</y>

<y>If you have not played this game - or games like it, namely mystery games - and you are a fan of puzzles I'd highly recommend it. 
It is indeed a challenging experience - wheras watching or reading a murder mystery is a passive experience, actually trying to 
solve a mystery is a different matter, and it is quite a bit more difficult.

I highly recommend the youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@COOPFORTWO for more of an introduction here.</y>
